	<p>
		Hi, I'm <strong>Goutham Patley</strong>. I build distributed systems that scale 
		and keep working when everything around them is breaking.
	</p>

	<p>
		I currently work at <strong>AWS</strong> in Sunnyvale, CA on the BigMac team, 
		managing ~1M Lambda instances. I focus on health systems, grey failure detection, 
		and automated incident response.
	</p>

	<h2>My Journey</h2>

	<p>
		I started my career at <strong>Hike Messenger</strong>, one of India's largest 
		messaging platforms with 100M+ users. There, I led the team that built India's 
		first <strong>UPI on chat</strong> — letting millions of people send money 
		through messages for the first time.
	</p>

	<p>
		At Hike, I learned to move fast. We shipped features in days, not weeks. 
		We built India's first UPI on chat in a matter of weeks. "Move fast" was 
		our mantra.
	</p>

	<p>
		Then I joined AWS. Managing 1M+ instances taught me a different lesson: 
		<strong>speed without reliability is just chaos waiting to happen</strong>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now I build systems that let teams ship fast <em>and</em> sleep at night. 
		Both matter.
	</p>

	<h2>What I Work On</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Health Systems:</strong> Making millions of instances observable and debuggable</li>
		<li><strong>Grey Failure Detection:</strong> Finding problems traditional monitoring misses</li>
		<li><strong>Automated Remediation:</strong> Reducing MTTR from 40 minutes to 5 minutes through automation</li>
		<li><strong>Large-Scale Infrastructure:</strong> Designing for scales we haven't hit yet</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Connect With Me</h2>

	<p>
		I'm always interested in talking about distributed systems, reliability, 
		and the lessons learned building at scale.
